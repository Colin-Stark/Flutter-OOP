# Dart OOP Concepts

This Flutter app provides a comprehensive demonstration of Dart OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) concepts. Understanding these principles is crucial for building scalable and maintainable software. Each concept is explained with code examples to help developers grasp the fundamental concepts of OOP in Dart.

## Concepts

### Classes

In OOP, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. A class defines the properties (attributes) and methods (functions) that objects of the class will have.

```dart
class Employee {
  int id;
  String name;

  void displayEmployeeDetails() {
    print("Employee ID: \$id");
    print("Employee Name: \$name");
  }
}
```

### Objects

Objects are instances of classes. They encapsulate data and behavior. Creating an object involves using the `new` keyword followed by the class name.

```dart
Employee emp = new Employee();
emp.id = 1;
emp.name = "John Doe";
emp.displayEmployeeDetails();
```

### Inheritance

Inheritance is a mechanism that allows a class (subclass/child) to inherit properties and methods from another class (superclass/parent). It promotes code reuse and simplifies the development process.

```dart
class Manager extends Employee {
  String department;

  void displayManagerDetails() {
    print("Manager Department: \$department");
  }
}
```

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. It enables a single interface to represent different types of objects.

```dart
class Manager extends Employee {
  String department;

  @override
  void displayEmployeeDetails() {
    super.displayEmployeeDetails();
  }
}
```

### Constructor

A constructor is a special method of a Dart class that is automatically called when an object is created. It initializes the object's properties.

```dart
class Customer {
  String name;
  int age;
  String location;

  Customer(String name, int age, String location) {
    this.name = name;
    this.age = age;
    this.location = location;
  }

  // Usage
  var customer = Customer("Emaan", 22, "pak");
}
```

### Try this
```dart
enum Gender{MALE,FEMALE}

class Employee {
  String name;
  int? age;
  Gender? gender;


  Employee({
    required this.name, 
    this.age,
    this.gender
    
  });
  
}

void main() {
  
  Employee details = Employee(name: 'JEROME',age: 30,gender: Gender.MALE);
  
  print(
    'Name  : ${details.name}\nAge   : ${details.age}\nGender: ${details.gender}'
  );

}

```

### Encapsulation

Encapsulation is the bundling of data (attributes) and methods that operate on the data within a class. Dart supports encapsulation through public, private, and protected keywords for controlling access to class members.

```dart
class Example {
  String publicVar;
  int _privateVar; // Private variable

  Example(this.publicVar, this._privateVar);

  int getPrivateVar() {
    return _privateVar;
  }

  setPrivateVar(int value) {
    _privateVar = value;
  }
}
```
